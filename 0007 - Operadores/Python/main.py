#*# *	Multiplication	a * b = 200
#*# /	Division	b / a = 2
#*# %	Modulus	b % a = 0
#*# **	Exponent	a**b =10**20
#*# //	Floor Division	9//2 = 4

### ? Comparison Operators
#*#     ==	Equal	(a == b) is not true.
#*#     !=	Not equal	(a != b) is true.
#*#     >	Greater than	(a > b) is not true.
#*#     <	Less than	(a < b) is true.
#*#     >=	Greater than or equal to	(a >= b) is not true.
#*#     <=	Less than or equal to	(a <= b) is true.

#*#     /=	a /= 5	a = a / 5
#*#     %=	a %= 5	a = a % 5
#*#     **=	a **= 4	a = a ** 4
#*#     //=	a //= 5	a = a // 5
#*#     &=	a &= 5	a = a & 5
#*#     |=	a |= 5	a = a | 5
#*#     ^=	a ^= 5	a = a ^ 5
#*#     >>=	a >>= 5	a = a >> 5
#*#     <<=	a <<= 5	a = a << 5
